| Integrating UI libraries that works directly with the DOM |          React          |                                                               Some UI libraries work with the DOM directly. In JSX, `<div>hi</div>` is syntactic sugar for `React.createElement("div", null, "hi")`. We don't have access to DOM nodes in our function component. DOM nodes aren't created at all until the `ReactDOM.render` method is called. Functional components are responsible for creating our React elements and it’s bad practice to interact directly with the DOM in React. To access the DOM, ask React to give you access to a DOM node when it renders your component. This happens with the prop named `ref`.                                                                |                                  [Twitter post](https://twitter.com/TommiEng/status/1569774903141736449) and [Raw code](/snippets/react-accessing-the-dom-13-09-2022.jsx)                                  |

This is pretty similar to our previous example of side-effects in interacting with the DOM, or using APIs like localStorage. What those have in common is that they all work with the `useEffect` hook. I personally found it simpler to use the Promise-based `.then` statement rather than using the `async`/`await` syntax, but it's really up to you how you'd rather do it.                                                                                                  |                                    [Twitter post](https://twitter.com/TommiEng/status/1570811589540052993) and [Raw code](/snippets/react-http-request-15-09-2022.jsx)                                     |
|              HTTP requests — handling errors              |          React          | Mistakes inevitably happen and errors will need handling so users don't get confounded. When handling Promise errors, there are different options like using the `.catch` statement or using the second argument of the Promised-based `.then` statement. When using the `.catch` statement, you handle errors in the Promise. However, you also handle an error in the `setWinners(data)` call, because of our Promises work. When using the second argument of the `.then` statement, you catch errors that happens in the `fetch` only. In our example, I thought calling `setWinners` would not throw an error because React handles it, so I tried the second argument way of doing it. |                            [Twitter post](https://twitter.com/TommiEng/status/1572329881559617536) and [Raw code](/snippets/react-http-requests-handling-errors.20-09-2022.jsx)                            |

By adding a state to represent the status of our components' explicitly, you won't have to worry about what state you might get, and how to show it for a particular case, and when to set or not set it for other use cases. Here are examples of possible states we can work with: **idle**: _No request has been sent._, **ending**: _Started request_, **resolved**: _Successful request._, **rejected**: _Failed request._                                                                           |                                [Twitter post](https://twitter.com/TommiEng/status/1573045780566650880) and [Raw code](/snippets/react-http-requests-status-22-09-2022.jsx)                                 |

Even though that new feature is available, it’s better to group those related states together in an object instead of creating individual different states. P.S.: I removed the error state just for the sake of readability.                             |                             [Twitter post](https://twitter.com/TommiEng/status/1574825871482961921) and [Raw code](/snippets/react-http-requests-state-object-27-09-2022.jsx)                              |

This can be useful when trying to take a value from the user's input in a form, but you want it as a `Number` instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                [Twitter post](https://twitter.com/TommiEng/status/1504115938454552582) and [Raw code](/snippets/js-convert-string-to-number-16-03-2022.js)                                 |

Try the rest params syntax! If you recall the post on the spread syntax, you might notice they look similar. Funny thing is, they're actually opposites! The rest parameter syntax is a way to catch any remaining variables we didn't account for. It's useful to think of it as they are unlimited amounts of arguments to a function. The way to indicate that is with the `...` notation.                                                                                                                   |                                    [Official post](https://twitter.com/TommieNg/status/1578440685576781825), and [raw code](/snippets/js-rest-parameters-07-10-2022.js)                                    |
